# An OAI-PMH Harvester

This is an OAI-PMH capable harvester build by Jan Fr√∂mberg ([jan.froemberg@tu-dresden.de](mailto:jan.froemberg@tu-dresden.de)).
It supports the metadata standards DublinCore and DataCite3.1.
This harvester was build on top of a [RESTful-Harvester Library][1] provided by the University of Kiel ([Robin Weiss](mailto:row@informatik.uni-kiel.de)).
It is a first build-release to support a harvesting use case for the [PANGAEA Metadata-Repository][6].

## Prerequisites

[Docker][3] if you plan to build the harvester within a Docker-Image.
Otherwise you need a Java Application Server like [Glassfish][2], [Tomcat][5] or [Jetty][4]
There you have to deploy the created war-File.

## How to build?

You can easily build a docker image by using the terminal and typing:

    $ mvn clean verify -DdockerBuild

There is also a utility script for building and running a Jetty docker container via:

    $ mvn clean verify -DdockerRun
